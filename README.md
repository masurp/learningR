# learning R - CPRN workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to learning R with Philipp! In roughly 2 hours, we will learn how to use 
R for basic data wrangling, statistical analyses, and if time permits, a bit of multilevel modeling (as this can be very useful for comparative projects!)

This page contains all materials for the workshop. These contain handouts, that we will work through during the workshop. However, they are usually well documented and commented so that you should be able to work through them by yourself after the workshop. For more such handouts on various topics related to using R, have a look at the following [github repository](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material) that my colleagues and I set up at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 


## Preparation

Before the workshop, please make sure that you have R and Rstudio installed on your computer and have played around a little with it (it is open source and free to use). Please work through the initial steps outlined in this handout:
